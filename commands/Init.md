# Git Init
The `git init` command is used to create an empty git repository.
If you wanted to create a new directory and initializa a git repository, you can do so with the following commands:
```
mkdir NewDirectory
cd NewDirectory
git init
```
Once inside a git repository, you can start using commands such as
[status](./status.md)
[add](./add.md)
[commit](./commit.md)
[push](./pull.md)
and more

Init will create the repository in the current directory and will encapsulate all content, including other directories.
